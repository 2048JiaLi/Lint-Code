## Description
**Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.**

**You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.**

## Example
```
Example 1:

Input：[1, 2, 3] 3  [4,5]  2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Example 2:

Input：[1,2,5] 3 [3,4] 2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
### Python range()的逆序迭代 for i in range(m+n-1,-1,-1):
```
A,m,B,n = [1,3,4,6,0,0], 4 ,[2,5], 2
